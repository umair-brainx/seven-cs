</ol>
<h2 >Seven C&rsquo;s of Communication &ndash; Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Seven C&rsquo;s framework is a checklist for effective communication.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Clear:&nbsp;Easy to understand, free of ambiguity &ndash; use simple language and focus on key points<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Concise:&nbsp;Brief and to the point &ndash; remove unnecessary details<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Concrete:&nbsp;Specific and tangible &ndash; supported by facts or examples<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Correct:&nbsp;Accurate and error-free &ndash; both in content and form (no factual or grammatical mistakes)<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Coherent:&nbsp;Logical and well-structured &ndash; information flows in an organized way<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Complete:&nbsp;Contains&nbsp;all&nbsp;necessary information &ndash; so the audience has everything needed to understand the message<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Courteous:&nbsp;Polite and positive &ndash; respectful tone, mindful of the audience&rsquo;s perspective<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >
<p >These principles are universal but we will apply them to scenarios relevant to Tech teams. For example, a&nbsp;complete&nbsp;communication for a developer might mean including code version and steps to reproduce in a bug report (not just &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;), whereas for a project manager it might mean providing timelines, not just saying &ldquo;project delayed.&rdquo; Emphasize that&nbsp;when in doubt, especially with complex or technical topics, it&rsquo;s better to err on the side of being&nbsp;complete&nbsp;even if it means adding a bit more detail&nbsp;&ndash; completeness should not be sacrificed for brevity if it risks misunderstanding.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 >1- Clarity &ndash; Clear Communication&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Clarity&nbsp;means your message is immediately and easily understood, with no ambiguity. You convey exactly what you mean. In practice, this means using common words (or defined technical terms), structuring sentences clearly, and ensuring context is provided.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Tech Example (Bad):&nbsp;&ldquo;The module isn&rsquo;t working right; fix it ASAP.&rdquo; &ndash; Here the intent is unclear (which module? what is &ldquo;not working&rdquo;?). Another example: a project requirement like &ldquo;Make the UI better.&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;Better in what way?&nbsp;Such vague messages cause confusion and back-and-forth. As one developer noted,&nbsp;&ldquo;I was given brief and vague information, resulting in a lot of time spent trying to understand someone else's riddle&rdquo;. In tech teams, what one person thinks is a clear message can often be interpreted differently by another.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Tech Example (Good):&nbsp;Contrast with a clear version.&nbsp;Example rewrite:&nbsp;&ldquo;The&nbsp;payment processing module&nbsp;throws a&nbsp;NullReferenceException&nbsp;when a user submits the checkout form (see attached log excerpt).&nbsp;Expected:&nbsp;transaction completes with a confirmation message.&nbsp;Actual:&nbsp;users see an error page.&nbsp;Please investigate this bug today&nbsp;as it&rsquo;s blocking all credit card payments.&rdquo; This message provides specific details: which part of the system, what error, expected vs. actual outcome, and urgency. The clarity leaves little room for misinterpretation.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Tips for Clarity:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Know your purpose:&nbsp;Before communicating, identify what you need from the audience (information, action, approval), and make that explicit. For instance, start an email with &ldquo;Action Required: ...&rdquo; if you need something specific.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Use plain language:&nbsp;Avoid unnecessary jargon or explain it if the audience isn&rsquo;t familiar. (If communicating with a non-engineer or a new team member, that highly technical explanation might confuse them &ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;simple requests like &lsquo;set up the environment&rsquo; could not be enough when you are texting someone you have known only for a few weeks or an inexperienced intern&rdquo;.) Always assume the reader might not have the same background knowledge &ndash; provide a bit of context when needed.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Be specific:&nbsp;Names, dates, figures, and references add clarity. Saying &ldquo;the latest mobile app release (v2.3) on Android is crashing on launch&rdquo; is clearer than &ldquo;the app is broken.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Confirm understanding:&nbsp;In conversation, ask the listener to summarize or ask follow-up questions. In written form, encourage questions: e.g., &ldquo;Let me know if any detail is unclear.&rdquo; This feedback loop ensures your clarity is effective.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 >2- Conciseness &ndash; Concise Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Concise&nbsp;communication is about keeping your message brief and to the point. It means removing filler words, redundancies, and sticking to what&rsquo;s essential. In our tech context, this helps busy colleagues and clients grasp your point quickly without wading through unnecessary detail.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >The Balance with Clarity:&nbsp;Emphasize that concise&nbsp;does not&nbsp;mean cutting important information. It&rsquo;s about efficiency of words, not omitting needed content.&nbsp;&ldquo;Brevity should not come at the expense of meaning&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; we still need completeness (more on that later) even as we strive for brevity. A clear,&nbsp;complete&nbsp;message that&rsquo;s a bit longer is better than a short but confusing one. However, often we can have both clarity and brevity by smart editing.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Example (Bad):&nbsp;Present a verbose message.&nbsp;For instance:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi team, I just wanted to let you know that I have noticed an issue that seems to be causing problems with our software application. It appears that when a user tries to log in to the system using their credentials, occasionally, not always but in some cases, an error message will pop up and it might say something along the lines of &lsquo;unexpected system exception occurred, please contact admin&rsquo;. I think this might be something we should look into when possible, if everyone agrees.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;This message, while polite and somewhat clear, is rambling. It buries the key point (login error) in excessive wording. Listeners might tune out before the request (&ldquo;we should look into it&rdquo;) appears. As one engineer recounted,&nbsp;&ldquo;many times, I was sure I gave a detailed description of the problem, [but] my message was too complicated... and often too long!&rdquo;. More words&nbsp;can&nbsp;dilute clarity.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Example (Good):&nbsp;Show a concise rewrite of the above:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;Issue:&nbsp;Intermittent login errors for users. An &lsquo;Unexpected system exception&rsquo; message appears for some users after entering credentials.&nbsp;Action:&nbsp;Needs investigation &ndash; please confirm if you can replicate this bug.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;This version conveys the same crucial information in a fraction of the words. It uses bullet-like structure (Issue/Action) for brevity and clarity. Key details (what the error is and when it occurs) are retained, but fluff is removed.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Tips for Conciseness:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Stick to the point:&nbsp;Identify the core message or question in your communication and make that prominent.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Avoid redundancy:&nbsp;e.g. phrases like &ldquo;each and every&rdquo; or repeating the same idea in different words. Say it once, clearly.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Use bullet points or lists:&nbsp;As we just saw, structuring information as bullet points (for requirements, status updates, etc.) forces brevity and is easier to scan.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Edit ruthlessly:&nbsp;Encourage editing emails or documents before sending &ndash; remove filler words (&ldquo;just,&rdquo; &ldquo;actually,&rdquo; &ldquo;basically&rdquo;), and shorten long sentences. Often a second read-through can cut down ~20% of the words without losing meaning.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >One message = one topic:&nbsp;If an email or message contains multiple unrelated topics, consider splitting them. This keeps each communication focused and concise.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >
<p >Activity &ndash;&nbsp;Condense this message in one sentence or phrase. For example:&nbsp;&ldquo;At this point in time we are in a situation where the database is experiencing an overload of requests, which is having the effect of causing our website to respond in a very sluggish manner.&rdquo;&nbsp;Ask: &ldquo;How would you rephrase this concisely?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 >3- Concreteness &ndash; Concrete Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Concrete&nbsp;communication means your message is specific, tangible, and supported by evidence. It&rsquo;s the opposite of being vague. When you communicate concretely, the audience can&nbsp;visualize or understand exactly what you mean, because you&rsquo;ve given details or examples to anchor your message. In technical work, this often means using&nbsp;data, examples, or clear descriptions&nbsp;rather than abstract statements.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Why it matters:&nbsp;Concrete information improves understanding and retention. A tester&rsquo;s bug description with concrete details (error codes, screen images, steps) will get a faster fix than one that says &ldquo;feature X is broken.&rdquo; Similarly, a project status update like &ldquo;We completed 8 out of 10 tasks this sprint&rdquo; is more actionable than &ldquo;We made some progress.&rdquo; Concrete = clarity + credibility.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Example (Abstract vs. Concrete):<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Abstract:&nbsp;&ldquo;The new release significantly improved performance.&rdquo; &ndash; (How to quantify &ldquo;significantly&rdquo;? What metric?)<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Concrete:&nbsp;&ldquo;The new release improved page load time from 4s to 2s on average &ndash; a 50% performance increase.&rdquo; &ndash; This version gives a measurable fact. Anyone can understand the extent of improvement.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >
<p >Another example in a QA context:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Abstract:&nbsp;&ldquo;The app fails under certain conditions.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Concrete:&nbsp;&ldquo;When more than&nbsp;200 users&nbsp;log in simultaneously, the app returns&nbsp;&lsquo;Service Unavailable (503)&rsquo;&nbsp;errors about&nbsp;30%&nbsp;of the time.&rdquo; &ndash; Here we have numbers, the exact error message, and the scenario, making the problem crystal clear.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >
<p >Emphasize how the concrete versions use&nbsp;facts, numbers, or examples&nbsp;to strengthen the message. As Indeed&rsquo;s guidance suggests, using evidence and specific language makes your message logical and valid.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Interactive Example:&nbsp;Help&nbsp;&ldquo;concretize&rdquo;&nbsp;a vague statement: &ldquo;Our client is unhappy with the project.&rdquo; What specific facts would make this statement more concrete? Possible answers:&nbsp;&ldquo;Client X reported that the last deliverable missed 3 key requirements and was delivered 2 weeks late, leading to their dissatisfaction&rdquo;. Or&nbsp;&ldquo;Client survey feedback score dropped from 9 to 6 this month, indicating unhappiness with our project&rsquo;s progress.&rdquo;&nbsp;By adding concrete details (missed requirements, timeline, survey data), the issue becomes clear and actionable.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Tips for Concreteness:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Use numbers or data when available:&nbsp;Quantify your statements (e.g., &ldquo;5 out of 7 tests failed&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;several tests failed&rdquo;).<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Provide examples or scenarios:&nbsp;If explaining a concept or proposing a solution, give a real example. &ldquo;For example, if we implement feature X, our QA team can reduce testing time by using automated scripts&rdquo; &ndash; rather than just saying &ldquo;it will be better.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Avoid vague qualifiers:&nbsp;Words like &ldquo;soon,&rdquo; &ldquo;a lot,&rdquo; &ldquo;better&rdquo; are open to interpretation. Try to replace them with specifics (&ldquo;by March 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;increased by 20%&rdquo;, &ldquo;UI load time improved by 250ms&rdquo;, etc.).<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Visual aids:&nbsp;In technical communication, screenshots, diagrams, or code snippets can make abstract issues concrete. Mention that using a screenshot of an error or a snippet of a log file in a bug report makes the issue much more concrete to a developer.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >
<p >Real-world Tie-in:&nbsp;Connect concreteness to client communication. Clients especially appreciate concrete communication &ndash; for example, providing a concrete timeline (&ldquo;We will deliver the beta to you by&nbsp;April 30&rdquo;) and concrete outcomes (&ldquo;this feature will allow&nbsp;100 concurrent users&nbsp;without performance loss&rdquo;) builds trust. It shows you&rsquo;re not hand-waving but have a factual basis.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 >Exercise: Good vs. Bad Communication (Applying Clear, Concise, Concrete)&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Now that we&rsquo;ve covered&nbsp;Clear, Concise, Concrete&nbsp;(the first three C&rsquo;s), we will practice applying these in a realistic scenario. This activity reinforces the differences between a poorly crafted message and an effective one.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Example Scenario:&nbsp;Bad Message (to be handed out):<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, I need that thing ASAP. The last build was terrible. There are a lot of problems in the system. Can you fix everything and update me? This is urgent!!&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li >
<p >This message (perhaps from a project manager to a developer) is clearly problematic: it doesn&rsquo;t specify&nbsp;what&nbsp;&ldquo;thing&rdquo; or &ldquo;problems,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s rude/pressuring (&ldquo;terrible&hellip; fix everything&rdquo;), and gives no concrete detail or clear action. It&rsquo;s also very incomplete (no detail on what&rsquo;s wrong) and not courteous.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li >
<p >Task:&nbsp;Rewrite this into a professional, effective communication. A good rewritten version might be:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi [Dev Team], I tested&nbsp;Build v1.2.3&nbsp;and found several issues:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li >
<p >The&nbsp;login page&nbsp;crashes on incorrect password (no error message shown).<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Order summary&nbsp;is not updating when items are removed from the cart.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >These are high-priority bugs because they impact the release timeline.&nbsp;Could we prioritize fixing these within the next 2 days?&nbsp;Please let me know if you need more details or help reproducing them.&nbsp;Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p >&nbsp;This rewrite is clear (specific features and issues), concise (bullet-pointed issues, no rambling), concrete (specific pages and actions, not just &ldquo;a lot of problems&rdquo;), complete (lists what needs fixing, why it&rsquo;s important, and what is requested), and even courteous in tone.</p>
<h2 >4- Coherence &ndash; Coherent Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Coherent&nbsp;communication means that all parts of your message are logically connected and consistent. The message has a&nbsp;flow&nbsp;&ndash; it&rsquo;s well organized, and each point follows sensibly from the previous. Coherence also means your tone and information are consistent (no contradictions). Essentially, the audience should be able to&nbsp;follow your train of thought from start to finish.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Importance in Tech:&nbsp;In software teams, coherence is crucial when explaining complex ideas (like architecture decisions, or test plans). If you jump disjointedly between points, or present information out of order, people get lost. A coherent&nbsp;structure&nbsp;helps &ndash; e.g., when writing a design proposal, you might follow a structure:&nbsp;Background &rarr; Problem &rarr; Proposed Solution &rarr; Benefits &rarr; Next Steps. If these elements are jumbled, the reader will be confused.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Example &ndash; Incoherent Email:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;We might miss the deadline. The performance test results are attached. By the way, I think the login bug is resolved now. Earlier, we discussed adding more logging. Let&rsquo;s focus on the deadline &ndash; any ideas? The server load was high last week.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;This message jumps between deadline, test results, a bug, logging, back to deadline, then server load &ndash; no clear order. It&rsquo;s hard to follow or extract a coherent message.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Improving Coherence:&nbsp;Suggest ways to reorganize that email. For instance, group related points together: first discuss the deadline status and invite ideas to address delay, then address the separate issue of performance testing results, etc. Perhaps use paragraphs or bullets for different topics. As one developer advised,&nbsp;&ldquo;dividing your message into sections and subsections can work miracles&hellip; Text editing tools are very useful for making the message more digestible&rdquo;. Consider using headings or bullet lists in longer documents &ndash; even in Slack messages, breaking text with line breaks and clear topic separation improves readability.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Techniques for Coherence:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Logical structure:&nbsp;Follow a clear structure (chronological, cause-and-effect, problem-solution, etc., depending on message). For a meeting agenda, list items in a logical sequence; for a status update, maybe order by priority.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Use connectors:&nbsp;Words and phrases like &ldquo;first, secondly, finally,&rdquo; &ldquo;however,&rdquo; &ldquo;for example,&rdquo; &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; act like signposts for the reader. They guide the reader through your reasoning.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >One theme at a time:&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t mix unrelated topics in one message. If you need to communicate about an upcoming holiday AND a critical bug, separate those into distinct sections or communications. Coherence suffers when topics tangle together.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Consistent terminology:&nbsp;Use the same terms for the same concept throughout your message. For example, if you refer to a project code-named &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; in one sentence, don&rsquo;t suddenly call it &ldquo;the client app&rdquo; in the next without clarification &ndash; the reader might think you&rsquo;re talking about something different. Consistency equals coherence.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Review order:&nbsp;After drafting, quickly outline your own message&rsquo;s structure (even just by the main points) to see if it&rsquo;s logical. You can even&nbsp;read it aloud to yourself&nbsp;&ndash; points that feel out of place will stand out, indicating a coherence fix is needed.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 >5- Correctness &ndash; Correct Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Correct&nbsp;communication means that the information you convey is&nbsp;accurate,&nbsp;error-free, and appropriate. This covers&nbsp;factual correctness&nbsp;(the content is true and up-to-date) and&nbsp;technical correctness&nbsp;(grammar, spelling, punctuation, and format). If a message isn&rsquo;t correct, it can mislead or distract the audience. As Indeed&rsquo;s article notes,&nbsp;&ldquo;incorrect information can reduce your credibility&rdquo;&nbsp;and errors will distract or erode trust. In tech, where details matter (version numbers, API endpoints, specifications), correctness is vital.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Why it matters:&nbsp;Consider an email to a client with a small typo in a version number or an incorrect date &mdash; it can cause a big misunderstanding (e.g., they prepare for the wrong release). Or a requirements document with a mis-stated constraint can lead developers down the wrong path. Internally, if your Slack message has confusing grammar or missing punctuation, colleagues might misinterpret instructions. One anecdote: a developer shared an example where punctuation completely changed clarity &ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;Install Visual Studio Code npm Angular Git Docker We will configure later&rdquo;&nbsp;(a message lacking commas) was very confusing. Adding punctuation or correct grammar would turn it into clear instructions (e.g., &ldquo;Install Visual Studio Code, npm, Angular, and Git/Docker. We will configure later.&rdquo;). So, correctness in language is part of being clear.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Areas of Correctness:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Grammar and Spelling:&nbsp;While we&rsquo;re not in English class, basic grammar/spelling matters for professionalism. &ldquo;Lets eat Grandma&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat, Grandma&rdquo; &ndash; the classic example &ndash; shows how a missing comma can be catastrophic (and humorous). In less extreme cases, a poorly constructed sentence can mean the difference between&nbsp;&ldquo;users unable to log in&rdquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&ldquo;users are now able to log in.&rdquo;&nbsp;One missing word can invert meaning. Use spell-check tools and re-read important messages.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Factual Accuracy:&nbsp;Double-check numbers, dates, and facts. If you tell a client &ldquo;the server uptime is 99.9% this month&rdquo; or &ldquo;we closed 15 bugs this sprint,&rdquo; ensure those are correct. Providing incorrect data (even by mistake) can harm credibility. If unsure, it&rsquo;s better to say &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; or follow up later, than to guess wrong.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Correct Format/Audience:&nbsp;Make sure the communication style fits the medium and audience. For example, an official client deliverable should use the client&rsquo;s terminology correctly (if their role is &ldquo;VP of Engineering,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t call them &ldquo;CTO&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Contextual Correctness:&nbsp;Include the right people (correct recipients) and the correct level of detail for them. Sending a deeply technical analysis to a non-technical client could be seen as a misfire (not the correct way to communicate to that audience). This touches on courtesy/consideration as well.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >
<p >Tips for Ensuring Correctness:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Use tools:&nbsp;Grammar and spell-checkers (Grammarly, MS Word&rsquo;s checker) are helpful, but don&rsquo;t rely on them for context (they might not catch a wrong date or misuse of a correct word).<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Second pair of eyes:&nbsp;For critical docs (specifications, client reports), have a teammate review it &ndash; they might catch logical errors or missing info as well.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Read backward or aloud:&nbsp;A proofreading trick is to read your text backward or read it out loud; it helps catch errors because it breaks your mind&rsquo;s familiarity with the content.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Check names and numbers:&nbsp;Always double-check names (spelling of client/company names) and numbers (ensure that &ldquo;$1,000&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t mistakenly typed instead of &ldquo;$10,000&rdquo;, for example).<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Version control in communication:&nbsp;If you refer to &ldquo;attached document,&rdquo; make sure you actually attached it (common mistake!), and that it&rsquo;s the correct version. Little things like this are part of correctness too.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 >6- Completeness &ndash; Complete Communication&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Complete&nbsp;communication means your audience has&nbsp;all the information they need&nbsp;from your message, without needing to ask follow-up questions. It answers the basic questions (who, what, where, when, why, how) relevant to the topic. A complete message provides context, key details, and next steps so nothing essential is missing. If clarity is about&nbsp;being understood, completeness is about&nbsp;being thorough. This is arguably the most crucial &lsquo;C&rsquo; in technical teamwork because missing information can cause errors, rework, or delays. We intentionally emphasize&nbsp;Complete&nbsp;because tech teams often suffer when details are left out.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >The Cost of Incomplete Info:&nbsp;Give a relatable example: A QA engineer files a bug report but forgets to include the test environment or steps to reproduce. What happens? The developer cannot replicate the bug, and a back-and-forth ensues: dev asks for more info, QA adds details, maybe days pass &ndash; productivity drops. In fact, research from a developer forum found that&nbsp;&ldquo;the team responsible for fixing a bug often receives a report that isn&rsquo;t very detailed&hellip; incomplete reports lack steps to reproduce or technical specs, leading to an eternal ping-pong of messages to request missing details&rdquo;. This &ldquo;ping-pong&rdquo; wastes time and frustrates everyone. By contrast, a complete bug report (with all fields filled: steps, expected vs actual result, screenshots, environment, etc.) can be picked up and resolved much faster with minimal clarification needed.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Example &ndash; Incomplete vs. Complete:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Incomplete status update:&nbsp;&ldquo;Project Alpha is behind schedule. Will not finish this sprint.&rdquo; &ndash; This raises more questions than it answers:&nbsp;How far behind? Why? What&rsquo;s being done about it?&nbsp;The team or client reading this will&nbsp;have&nbsp;to ask follow-ups.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Complete status update:&nbsp;&ldquo;Project Alpha&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Status:&nbsp;1 week behind schedule due to&nbsp;2 developers out sick&nbsp;and&nbsp;unforeseen API issues. We&rsquo;ve rescheduled the remaining tasks and added an extra code review to catch up.&nbsp;New target completion:&nbsp;November 10 (was Nov 3).&nbsp;Impact:&nbsp;Launch date moved one week later; client has been informed and is okay with the new date.&nbsp;Action needed:&nbsp;Team to put in extra testing time next sprint to ensure quality with the compressed timeline.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>

<p >Tech Example &ndash; Bug Report (Incomplete vs Complete):<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Incomplete Bug Report:&nbsp;&ldquo;Login feature broken. Please fix ASAP.&rdquo; &ndash; Missing details galore: what&rsquo;s broken (cannot login at all, or just a specific case?), any error message? what environment? This will force the dev to ask &ldquo;Can you provide steps to reproduce?&rdquo; etc.<br /><br /></p>

<p >This comprehensive report provides all key info. A developer receiving this might not need to ask anything else before starting to investigate. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;complete.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Emphasize Behavior:&nbsp;Encourage a culture where team members aim to provide all relevant info upfront. Similarly, encourage&nbsp;receivers&nbsp;of communication to not shy away from asking questions if something is incomplete &ndash; but our goal is to minimize that need. Remind that sometimes&nbsp;&ldquo;when there is a risk of misunderstanding, it&rsquo;s better to be complete than concise&rdquo;. Particularly with client communication: giving the full context (even if it&rsquo;s a longer email) can prevent misalignment. For instance, if a client requests a feature change, a&nbsp;complete&nbsp;response might include: acknowledgement, impact on timeline/cost, options or alternatives, and next steps &ndash; rather than just &ldquo;Ok, we&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; which leaves out those details.<br /><br /></p>

<h2 >7- Courtesy &ndash; Courteous Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Definition:&nbsp;Courteous&nbsp;communication means communicating with respect, positivity, and empathy. It&rsquo;s about the&nbsp;tone&nbsp;and&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;of your message &ndash; being friendly and considerate of the recipient&rsquo;s feelings and perspectives. Even when delivering criticism or bad news, courteousness ensures professionalism. This also includes being mindful of cultural norms when working with international colleagues or clients (e.g., forms of address, level of directness, etc.). Essentially, treat the reader/listener as you would like to be treated, with politeness and consideration.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Why Courtesy Matters (Especially in Tech Teams):&nbsp;In high-pressure environments (tight deadlines, production outages), tempers can flare and communication can turn curt or hostile &ndash; but that usually backfires. A disrespectful code review comment or a rude email can demoralize the team and damage relationships. Conversely, courteous communication fosters a positive team culture and better collaboration. Externally, courtesy is crucial for client satisfaction &ndash; how we communicate is a direct reflection of our company&rsquo;s professionalism. Even if we have bad news (like a delay), delivering it courteously (apologizing for inconvenience, showing understanding of the client&rsquo;s position) can maintain trust.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Examples:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Internal &ndash; Discourteous vs. Courteous:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Discourteous feedback: &ldquo;What kind of logic is this? This code is a mess, didn&rsquo;t you even test it?&rdquo; (This attack not only demotivates the developer, but it&rsquo;s likely to cause defensiveness and conflict.)<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Courteous feedback: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble understanding this logic &ndash; could we simplify this section? I also noticed some test cases failing (e.g., edge case X). Let&rsquo;s work together to fix those.&rdquo; &ndash; This version still addresses the issue (code problems) but does so constructively, without personal insult, and offers help. It focuses on the code, not the person, and maintains respect.<br />&nbsp;Analysis:&nbsp;In the discourteous version, the author &ldquo;scolds&rdquo; the person, which, as a developer on Dev.to noted, achieves nothing beneficial:&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course, you could scold an intern for not making a backup, but what would you achieve? You&rsquo;d ruin your relationship and jeopardize future cooperation&rdquo;. The courteous approach, on the other hand, preserves the relationship and encourages improvement without blame.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >
<p >External (Client) &ndash; Discourteous vs. Courteous:&nbsp;Example: a client writes with confusion about a feature that doesn&rsquo;t meet their expectations.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >A bad response: &ldquo;You misunderstood the feature; we delivered exactly what was in the spec.&rdquo; (This may be factually true, but it&rsquo;s blaming the client and comes off as dismissive.)<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >A courteous response: &ldquo;Thank you for your feedback &ndash; I&rsquo;m sorry the feature isn&rsquo;t what you expected. I understand how this is important for your use case. Let&rsquo;s schedule a call to clarify the requirements and explore a solution.&rdquo; &ndash; Here we see empathy (&ldquo;understand your perspective&rdquo;), an apology for the inconvenience, and an offer to resolve the issue collaboratively. This tone can turn a potentially tense situation into a teamwork opportunity.<br />&nbsp;Also mention cultural courtesy: for international clients, being courteous might involve adjusting formality or phrasing. For example, in some cultures, it&rsquo;s expected to have a bit more formality in emails (using titles, not using first names immediately, etc.), or to avoid very direct negative statements. Being mindful of these differences is part of being courteous. If unsure, err on the side of polite formality.<br /><br /></p>

</ul>

</li>
<li >
<p >Elements of Courteous Communication:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Positive tone:&nbsp;Frame things positively where possible. Instead of &ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; say &ldquo;I see some challenges with that approach; perhaps we could try X.&rdquo; Avoiding harsh words or all-caps (which can seem like shouting) in written text.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Respect and empathy:&nbsp;Acknowledge the other person&rsquo;s point of view. Phrases like &ldquo;I understand that&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I appreciate&hellip;&rdquo; show you value their perspective. As the Dev.to author advised,&nbsp;&ldquo;develop empathy&hellip; respect and understand others to make sure they feel comfortable &ndash; that is key to successful communication&rdquo;. Put yourself in the other&rsquo;s shoes, especially when delivering criticism or bad news.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Politeness and manners:&nbsp;Simple courtesies like &ldquo;please,&rdquo; &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; greetings (&ldquo;Hi team,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear Alice,&rdquo;) and closings (&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; &ldquo;Regards&rdquo;) go a long way. Also, timely responses are a form of courtesy &ndash; not leaving someone&rsquo;s email unanswered for days. If you need time, a quick &ldquo;Got your message, I&rsquo;ll get back to you tomorrow&rdquo; is courteous.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Avoiding blame and accusations:&nbsp;Focus on solutions and facts, not pointing fingers. Use &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements instead of &ldquo;you&rdquo; in a blaming way. For example, &ldquo;We need to ensure tests cover this scenario&rdquo; vs &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t test this.&rdquo; The former is inclusive and problem-solving; the latter is accusatory.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Mindful of time and culture:&nbsp;Be punctual in meetings (respect others&rsquo; time). When working with global teams, be mindful of holidays, time zones, and potentially different communication styles (some may prefer more formal address, etc.). This shows respect for their background &ndash; a facet of courtesy.<br /><br /></p>
</li>

<h2 >Practical Takeaways for Each of the 7 C&rsquo;s (Summary)</h2>
<ul>
<li >
<p >Clear:&nbsp;Be easily understood.&nbsp;Define your purpose and stick to it. Use simple language (or explain technical terms) so that even a new team member or client grasps your message. Before sending, ask &ldquo;Could someone misunderstand this?&rdquo; If yes, clarify it.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Concise:&nbsp;Be brief and impactful.&nbsp;Cut unnecessary words and get to the point quickly. Use bullet points or short sentences for readability. A concise message respects everyone&rsquo;s time while still conveying the needed info &ndash; no fluff, no ramble.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Concrete:&nbsp;Be specific and tangible.&nbsp;Provide examples, data, or details to support your points. Replace vague terms (&ldquo;soon,&rdquo; &ldquo;a lot&rdquo;) with specifics (&ldquo;by Monday 5 PM,&rdquo; &ldquo;increase of 25%&rdquo;). This makes your message credible and clear.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Correct:&nbsp;Be accurate and error-free.&nbsp;Double-check facts, figures, and grammar. An accurate message builds trust &ndash; people know they can rely on the information. Proofread important communications (or have a colleague review) to avoid embarrassing mistakes.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Coherent:&nbsp;Be logical and organized.&nbsp;Present information in a sensible order that flows naturally. Group related topics together. Use headings or transitions to guide the reader. A coherent message is easy to follow and remember.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Complete:&nbsp;Be thorough.&nbsp;Include all relevant information and context so the receiver isn&rsquo;t left with questions. Anticipate what your audience needs to know &ndash; the who, what, where, when, why, how. Don&rsquo;t make them hunt for missing pieces or ask for clarification. Before sending, do a final check: &ldquo;Did I include everything important?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li >
<p >Courteous:&nbsp;Be respectful and friendly.&nbsp;Use a polite tone, even under stress. Acknowledge others&rsquo; perspectives and time. Little courtesies &ndash; greetings, &ldquo;please/thank you,&rdquo; timely responses &ndash; build goodwill. Avoid blame; focus on solutions and maintain a collaborative, positive approach.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
</ul>
